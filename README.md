# csp-2024-final
final project for SSHS AP CSP (June 2024)
hii this is my final project for AP Computer Science Principles at SSHS (23-24)
The project is a probability checker for the hit gacha game Genshin Impact!
It's based off of the games wishing system, where a 4 star character or item is guaranteed for every ten wishes
The ten_wishes function will calculate the probabilty of the likelyhood of your next wish being the four star within a set of ten wishes
so lets say of you made 5 wishes already, it would tell you the percent chance that your next wish will be a four star
Another big part of Genshin impacts wishing system is the 50/50
In genshin impact there are characters categorized as 5 star characters
there are two kinds of 50/50 characters, the limited and the standard
when people pull a limited character it's considered a win
and when people pull a standard character it's considered a loss
the fifty_fifty function calculated the probility of if the user is going to win or lose their next fifty_fifty based off of the results from their last 50/50
